    One of the most popular festivals of Hinduism, Diwali symbolizes the spiritual "victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance". The festival is widely associated with Lakshmi, goddess of prosperity, and Ganesha, god of wisdom and the remover of obstacles, with many other regional traditions connecting the holiday to Sita and Rama, Vishnu, Krishna, Durga, Shiva, Kali, Hanuman, Kubera, Yama, Yami, Dhanvantari, or Vishvakarman. Furthermore, it is a celebration of the day Rama returned to his kingdom in Ayodhya with his wife Sita and his brother Lakshmana after defeating the demon Ravana in Lanka and serving 14 years of exile. Diwali holds significance for Hindus as it symbolizes the victory of good over evil. It is a five-day-long festive period that begins with Dhanteras and ends with Bhai Dooj. This year, Diwali falls on Monday, October 24. People prepare for Diwali by cleaning their homes and decorating them with Diya, flowers, and lights, making rangolis, buying new clothes and jewelry, and eating lots of delicacies. One of the most significant rituals of this festival is the Lakshmi Puja. Devotees pray to Goddess Lakshmi on this day for blessing them with health, wealth, and prosperity.
